| `minReplicas` _integer_ | MinReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas for the target resource.<br />It will be used by the horizontal pod autoscaler to determine the minimum number of replicas to scale-in to. |  |  |

Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is<br />increased, and vice versa.
