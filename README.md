# Grove: 

Grove is an open-source Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR) and scheduling framework purpose-built for orchestrating workloads where the fundamental unit of scaling for some components is a group of pods, rather than a single pod, while other components operate as standard deployments. It allows you to represent multiple such components within a single CR, enabling them to start up reliably and communicate efficiently through gang scheduling and topology-aware placement.

Grove was originally motivated by the challenges of orchestrating multinode, disaggregated inference systems. It provides a single control plane that allows users to represent, configure, and scale prefill, decode, and any other components like routing within a single CR. However it is flexible enough to represent all manner of systems, and cleanly models anything from "traditional" single node aggregated inference to agentic pipelines with multiple models.

## üå≤ Why Grove?

Modern inference systems are often no longer single-pod workloads. They involve multiple components running across many nodes, often requiring coordination, colocation, custom roles, and precise startup ordering.

Grove makes this complexity manageable by providing the following:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Capabilities

- ‚úÖ **Declarative Super-Pod Orchestration**  
  Define tightly coupled pod groups with explicit role-based logic. E.g. a group of pods that scale together where one pod is a leader and the rest are workers

- ‚úÖ **Gang Scheduling**  
  Ensure all pods in a super-pod are scheduled together to prevent resource deadlocks.

- ‚úÖ **Multi-Component Coordination**  
  Cleanly represent patterns like prefill/decode disaggregation with independent scaling and resource allocation.

- ‚úÖ **Topology-Aware Placement**  
  Schedule pods close together (rack-aware, spine-aware, etc.) to optimize network performance‚Äîpowered.

- ‚úÖ **Custom Startup Dependencies**  
  Specify which roles must be ready before others launch without brittle startup scripts. Pod startup is decoupled from pod creation

- ‚úÖ **Unified Control Plane**  
  Manage inference workers, request routers, and frontend servers together using a single resource definition.


## üß© Core Concepts

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **PodGangSet** | The top-level Grove object that defines a group of components managed together. Supports replication and availability-zone-aware deployment. |
| **PodClique**  | A group of pods representing a specific role (e.g., leader, worker). Each clique has independent configuration and scaling logic. |
| **ScalingGroup** | A set of PodCliques that scale and schedule together as a logical super-pod. Ideal for tightly coupled roles like prefill and decode. |
