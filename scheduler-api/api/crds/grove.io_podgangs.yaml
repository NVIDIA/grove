                  TerminationDelay is a delay timer that activates gang termination of a running PodGang
                  whenever the number of running pods violates the minReplicas constraint of any PodGroup.
                  It allows for a grace period to allow the scheduler to schedule the pods again so that they
                  are equal to or greater than the minReplicas, thus preventing unnecessary PodGang termination.
