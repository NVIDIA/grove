## Scaling Groups: MinAvailable and Gang Scheduling

Grove's PodClique Scaling Groups provide sophisticated gang scheduling and termination protection through two key configuration parameters: `replicas` and `minAvailable`.

### Overview

**Scaling Groups** allow you to group multiple PodCliques together and scale them as a unit while maintaining gang scheduling semantics. This is particularly useful for distributed workloads that require coordinated scheduling and graceful scaling behavior.

### Key Configuration Parameters

#### `replicas`
- **Purpose**: Sets the desired number of replicas for the scaling group
- **Default**: 1 if not specified
- **Behavior**: Controls how many instances of the scaling group are created

#### `minAvailable` 
- **Purpose**: Defines the minimum number of ready replicas required for operational stability
- **Default**: 1 if not specified  
- **Behavior**: Enables gang scheduling and controls termination policies

### Gang Scheduling Behavior

Grove implements a sophisticated **two-tier gang scheduling** system based on the `minAvailable` setting:

#### Base PodGang (Core Cluster)
- **Replicas**: 0 through (`minAvailable` - 1) 
- **Scheduling**: All pods scheduled together as a single gang
- **Purpose**: Establishes the minimum viable cluster
- **Gates Removed**: Immediately when pods are assigned to the PodGang

#### Scaled PodGangs (Scale-Out Replicas) 
- **Replicas**: `minAvailable` and above
- **Scheduling**: Each replica gets its own scaled PodGang
- **Purpose**: Provides additional capacity once core functionality is established
- **Gates Removed**: Only **after** the base PodGang is ready and running

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Database Cluster
```yaml
apiVersion: grove.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodGangSet
spec:
  template:
    podCliqueScalingGroupConfigs:
    - name: "database-cluster"
      replicas: 5
      minAvailable: 3
      cliqueNames: ["db-primary", "db-secondary"]
```

**Behavior**:
- **Replicas 0, 1, 2**: Form base PodGang, scheduled together (minimum viable cluster)
- **Replicas 3, 4**: Scaled PodGangs, wait for base cluster to be ready
- **Result**: Ensures core 3-node cluster is operational before adding scale-out nodes

#### Scenario 2: Machine Learning Training
```yaml
apiVersion: grove.io/v1alpha1  
kind: PodGangSet
spec:
  template:
    podCliqueScalingGroupConfigs:
    - name: "ml-training"
      replicas: 8
      minAvailable: 4
      cliqueNames: ["parameter-server", "worker"]
```

**Behavior**:
- **Replicas 0, 1, 2, 3**: Base PodGang for core training infrastructure
- **Replicas 4, 5, 6, 7**: Scaled PodGangs for additional training capacity
- **Result**: Core training cluster established before scaling out workers

### Ready Replica Definition

A scaling group replica is considered **"ready"** when:
- Its associated PodClique has sufficient ready Pods: `PodClique.Status.ReadyReplicas >= PodClique.Spec.MinReplicas`
- A Pod is considered ready when its `PodReady` condition is `True`

### Gang Termination Protection

If the number of ready replicas falls below `minAvailable`:
- **Gang termination** is triggered for the affected scaling group replica
- **Purpose**: Prevents resource waste and maintains workload integrity
- **Behavior**: Ensures workloads fail fast rather than running in degraded states

### Benefits

#### **Efficient Resource Utilization**
- Core functionality established first before scaling out
- Prevents wasteful scheduling of non-essential replicas

#### **Workload Stability** 
- Gang scheduling ensures all-or-nothing scheduling semantics
- Termination protection maintains minimum viable cluster size

#### **Graceful Scaling**
- Base cluster provides stable foundation 
- Scale-out replicas add capacity without disrupting core functionality
