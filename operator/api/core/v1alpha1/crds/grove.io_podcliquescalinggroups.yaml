          PodCliqueScalingGroup is the schema to define scaling groups that is used to scale a group of PodClique's.

                description: |-
                  MinAvailable specifies the minimum number of ready replicas required for the group to be considered operational.
                  A scaling group replica is considered "ready" when its associated PodClique has sufficient ready Pods
                  (PodClique.Status.ReadyReplicas >= PodGroup.MinReplicas), where a Pod is ready when its PodReady condition is True.

                  It serves two main purposes:
                  1. Gang Scheduling: Replicas 0 through (MinAvailable-1) are grouped into the base PodGang and scheduled together.
                     Additional replicas (MinAvailable and above) are scaled PodGangs that wait for the base PodGang to be ready
                     before their scheduling gates are removed.
                  2. Gang Termination: If MinAvailable is breached, it will trigger gang-termination of the scaling group replica.
                  If not specified, it defaults to 1.
