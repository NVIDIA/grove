// ExpectationsStore is a cache where add and delete expectations are captured.
// `controller-runtime` serves the read requests from an informer cache and will query the kube-apiserver
// during startup or resyncs. The informer cache does not provide read-your-writes consistency which leads to stale
// caches. Informer caches are eventually consistent but if your controller gets quick events then it is possible
// that the controller operates on a stale state, thus leading to side effects which could include creation of adding
// resource replicas or deletion of more then desired replicas of a resource.
// NOTE: Expectations is an existing pattern already used in kubernetes.
// See [ControllerExpectationsInterface]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e6161070d4416f6d9c1ac9961029fdceef5c9286/pkg/controller/controller_utils.go#L157
// where expectations are used to provide a barrier when reconciling resources. If the previous expectations are not fulfilled, or they have not yet expired
// no further resource creation/deletion will be done.
// This implementation takes inspiration from it but takes a different take on how resources are tracked.
// We propose to not use expectations as a barrier but only as an additional in-memory store of expectations that help
// the reconciler correctly compute the desired number of creates or deletes.
// It also attempts to resolve the 2 issues that are listed in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/129795#issuecomment-2657716713
